### Lots of different backgrounds here!

# Why are you here? Why R/Python? Why now?

---

# Why should you learn R/Python?

* Free, improves, have existed for a long time
* Students can show what they have learned to a potential employer easily
* The support system for R and Python are actually very good!
  * Many free textbooks online
  * Tons of announcements and content on Twitter
  * [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for coding questions

# But why should YOU learn R/Python?

* R/Python (and eventually Quarto) will save you TONS of time. Long term thinking is key.

--

  * You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
  
--

  * Remembering what drop-down menu something is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
  
--

  * Remembering to copy-and-paste your updated plots/analysis into your word processor is a pain and error prone

# Good Coding Habits


* [Good coding style](https://style.tidyverse.org/) -- Use a consistent style!

--

* Use some form of Git

# Let's Get Started

* [Installing Python](https://www.anaconda.com/)

  * Click "Download" and follow the directions to install the Anaconda distribution of Python
  
--


* [Installing R](https://www.r-project.org/)

  * Follow the "Getting Started" directions to download and install R
  
--

* [Installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

  * Click on "RStudio Desktop" and follow the directions to download and install the **open source edition** of RStudio Desktop

# Working with R through RStudio

* R/Python are the languages

--

* RStudio/Jupyter/Colab are IDEs (integrated development environment) -- not required to work with the languages, but highly recommended

--

# Basic Ways to Use R in RStudio

1. In the Console Pane

  * Try `2 + 2` and hit Enter

--

2. In an R script (.R) file

  * File -> New File -> R Script
  
--

  * Type `2 + 2` in your script, select/highlight it, and then hit Ctrl + Enter
  
* You just ran your first line of code!

* Notice that both showed up in your Console pane

# Basic Ways to Use Python in Colab (and Juypter)

* Let's play around in Google Colab a bit!
